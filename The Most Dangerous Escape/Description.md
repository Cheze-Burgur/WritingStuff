## The Most Dangerous Escape
This is an assignment for my English class, but it turned out pretty good, so I thought it would be cool if I shared it.
Basically, we read a bunch of short stories in class over the course of a month, and we had to write a sequel to one of them for the assignment. Two page minimum, 12pt Times New Roman font, etc.
This is 6 pages, 1624 words long.
